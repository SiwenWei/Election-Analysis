# Election-Analysis

In this project I analyzed two datasets from 2012 US election. The first data set is the results of political polls. I tried to analyze this aggregated poll data for the answers to the following questions:

1.) Who was being polled and what was their party affiliation?
2.) Did the poll results favor Romney or Obama?
3.) How do undecided voters effect the poll?
4.) Can the undecided voters be accounted?
5.) How did voter sentiment change over time?
6.) Can an effect in the polls from the debates be seen?
